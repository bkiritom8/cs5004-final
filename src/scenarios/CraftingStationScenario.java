/**
 * Scenario 4: Activating a Crafting Station
 *
 * The player enters a Cave and notices an arrangement of wood and stones â€” this is a Crafting Station.
 * The station appears inactive until the player has both Iron and Diamond.
 * When the player interacts with the station while holding both, the items are removed,
 * and a new item, Diamond Sword, is crafted and added to inventory.
